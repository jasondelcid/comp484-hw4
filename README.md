# Comp 484 - Homework 4 - Semantic Lists

## Overview
This assignment focuses on identifying where lists are semantically appropriate and restructuring existing HTML content to use the correct list types.

## Features Implemented
- Converted site navigation on all pages from paragraph-based links to unordered lists (`ul` and `li`)
- Converted the HTML timeline into an ordered list (`ol`)
- Reorganized the Doctypes section into a description list (`dl`, `dt`, `dd`)
- Reorganized the HTML Terms section into a description list (`dl`, `dt`, `dd`)
- Maintained consistent semantic HTML structure using `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, and `footer` elements
- Preserved original styling without modifying CSS
